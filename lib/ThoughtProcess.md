## My Goals

I want to make a CLI that displays up-to-date stats about COVID-19.  


### Scraper

1. Build a Scraper class that scrapes all the stats from the website.  
2. Send that data to a class to represent that data.  

### Virus/Country

1. Build a Virus class that represents the world stats.  
2. Build a Country class that represents the stats of an individual country.  
3. The Virus class *has many* instances of Country.  

### CLI

1. Build a CLI class that is responsible for front-end/user interactions.  
2. Have a few different options of world stats to show (from the Virus instance).  
3. Give the option to list the top 20 countries, and select a specific country to view that stats of.
